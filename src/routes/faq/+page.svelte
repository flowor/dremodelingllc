        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          Our buildings are divided into five different categories, their dimensions are identified by Width X Length X Height i.e (20X40X9) which indicates a 20 feet wide, 40 feet long, and 9 feet high building. Each carport has customizable components and additions. Please use our <a class="underline hover:text-ssdblue-950 text-ssdblue-700" href="{modelerUrl}">3D design tool to learn more!</a>

        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          Metal buildings can be installed on a concrete pad, footing, asphalt, gravel, and dirt. All surfaces must be leveled within 3 to 4 inches. If equipped with garage doors, some buildings will require a completely leveled surface to avoid any gaps. We recommend checking with your local building authority and with us prior to pouring any concrete to comply with local guidelines.

          Two types of anchoring are available. For structures mounted on a concrete pad or footing, traditional concrete wedge anchors are used. A 30-inch rebar anchor is offered for structures mounted directly on dirt or gravel surfaces.

        <span slot="header">Are lightning strikes a concern for steel buildings? </span>
        <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
          Lightning is not a significant danger for steel buildings because steel is a good conductor of electricity, directing the energy safely into the ground. This is in contrast to wood-framed buildings, where lightning strikes could potentially start fires. Similarly, if a steel building is exposed to live electrical wires, the energy would be conducted safely to the ground, protecting the interior just like in conventional construction with circuit breakers.

    <span slot="header">Is purchasing a steel building more cost-effective compared to traditional construction methods? </span>
    <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400">
      Prefabricated metal buildings are indeed one of the most economical choices for new construction. They are tailored and engineered for each project, minimizing wasted materials and significantly reducing unnecessary building costs. Additionally, their quick assembly saves on labor expenses. Furthermore, with standard designs, you'll benefit from long-term savings due to reduced maintenance needs.
